            <p><strong>Indoor comfort isn't a luxury, it's a basic condition of daily life.</strong></p>
            <p>But comfort is shaped by complex and invisible systems: heat transfer, insulation, airflow, solar exposure. When residents can't access or interpret this data, they're left guessing.</p>
            <p>In NYC, where over 70% of carbon emissions come from buildings, the urgency is growing.</p>
            <p>Energy prices are rising, and climate extremes are putting more strain on both infrastructure and residents. Yet most modeling tools are built for professionalsâ€”not for those actually living in these buildings.</p>
            <p>This project is motivated by the need to change that.</p>

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>This project represents a step toward democratizing building science knowledge and empowering everyday New Yorkers to take control of their indoor environments.</p>
        
        <p>Through the development of an AI-powered platform that translates complex building science into accessible insights, we can bridge the gap between professional expertise and public understanding.</p>
        
        <p>The combination of computational design, citizen science, and AI technology creates a unique opportunity to address both individual comfort needs and broader environmental challenges.</p>
        
        <p>As we face increasing energy costs and climate extremes, tools like this become essential for building resilient, comfortable, and sustainable communities.</p>
