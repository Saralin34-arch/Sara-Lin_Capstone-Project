# AI Home Energy Coach

**Toward Accessible, Data-Driven Energy Literacy for Renters and Residents**

An AI-powered web application that translates architectural layouts, usage behaviors, and environmental data into customized, actionable comfort strategies for everyday people.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Despite growing awareness of climate change and energy efficiency, many urban renters and homeowners—especially those in older or multi-unit buildings—lack the tools to make informed decisions about their home's energy performance. This project addresses that gap by providing an accessible, AI-driven feedback tool that helps users improve their indoor comfort and reduce bills without requiring major renovation.
